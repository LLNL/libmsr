To build the library:

The NUM_PACKAGES and NUM_CORES_PER_PACKAGE need to be set in msr_core.h correctly. You can find this information in /proc/cpuinfo.

This should create libmsr.so and librapl.so in the libmsr/lib folder.

===========================================

To link to the library:

(1) You can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the lib/ folder in the libmsr folder, or,  

(2) You can use dynamic liknking rpath with gcc/mpicc in your Makefile as follows: 

 mpicc -o <exec-name> <file-name.c> -Xlinker -rpath=<path-to-libmsr>/libmsr/lib -L<path-to-libmsr>/libmsr/lib -lrapl
===========================================

Modes:

There are three modes in which the library can be used. 

The default is the DRY_RUN mode, which does not read from or write to any
MSRs. This creates an empty file as output. The reason this mode exists is that if a user wants to test whether or not s/he is linking
to the library correctly and does not have the right permissions to access MSRs on that node/machine, s/he can use this. This is also
the default mode because we don't want any user who does not have enough clarity to access the registers. We expect
them to read this README file before progressing any further.

In the READ_ONLY mode, you can read the MSRs and a file with the power data would be created. 

In the READ_WRITE mode, you can clamp the PKG_LIMIT, PP0_LIMIT and DRAM_LIMIT to the power values that you are interested in.

To be able to use these modes, you need to export either the READ_ONLY environment variable, or the READ_WRITE environment variable 
appropriately and set it to 1. Note that if both the READ_ONLY and the READ_WRITE environment variables are exported, 
the library defaults to the READ_ONLY mode. 

In the READ_WRITE mode, you need to export the MSR_PKG_POWER_LIMIT, MSR_PP0_POWER_LIMIT and the MSR_DRAM_POWER_LIMIT environment variables
to use RAPL for clamping. More information on setting these can be found in the Intel Manual, Chapter 14. Note that the default for MSR_PKG_POWER_LIMIT is 0x6845000148398 and not 0x0. Setting this to 0x0 affects turbo boost.  

On a successful run, the READ_ONLY and READ_WRITE modes should create an output file (which begins with the hostname for the system) for each node (the MSR_RANK_MOD determines which rank in the MPI program creates this file). This file will contain node level power data. In case of the DRY_RUN mode, an empty file is created. 

===========================================

Error messages:

If you do not have the right permissions, the program should exit with a "Initialization failed. Exiting" error message. Also, check that
the cpuid and the msr modules are loaded. This can be done by using "lsmod." If not, ask your system administrator to give you the right permissions
for accessing the registers/relevant modules.
