LIBMSR
======

Welcome to Libmsr, a friendly (well, friendlier) interface to many of the
model-specific registers in Intel processors. Now with PCI configuration
register support for some Intel hardware.

version 0.3.1

Overview
--------

Libmsr provides an interface to accessing the model-specific registers (MSRs)
on Intel platforms, which provide privileged functionality for monitoring and
controlling various CPU features.


Installation
------------

Installation is simple. You will need [CMAKE](http://www.cmake.org) version 2.8
or higher and GCC. In most cases, the installation is as follows:

    $ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/build/libmsr
    $ make
    $ make install

The installation depends on a `master.h` file, which defines the offsets for
several MSRs given a particular architecture (e.g., Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge,
Haswell, etc.). The auto-configuration tool can be forced to use the header
file of a specific architecture or can auto-detect the architecture. To specify
a particular architecture, run `cmake` with the option
`-DLIBMSR_TARGET_ARCH=<ARG>` where `ARG` is in hexadecimal. In the future, we
plan to have a set of architecture-specific configuration files that can be
pre-loaded to CMake to populate the cache.

Currently supported architectures are Intel Xeon v1-3 (Sandy Bridge, Ivy
Bridge, and Haswell server processors). The library technically supports all
processors based on these architectures, but some features may be missing from
client products. Using the wrong header file is likely to cause problems.

Supported Architectures:

	2D (Sandy Bridge)       57 (Knights Landing)
	3E (Ivy Bridge)
	3F (Haswell)
	4F (Broadwell)
	55 (Skylake)*

If you are unsure of your architecture number, check the "model" field in `lscpu`
or `/proc/cpuinfo` (note that it will not be in hexadecimal).

*The Skylake support is currently experimental and requires more testing/validation. 

Notes
-----

This software depends on the files `/dev/cpu/*/msr` being present with R/W
permissions. Recent kernels require additional capabilities. We have found it
easier to use our own [MSR-SAFE](https://github.com/LLNL/msr-safe) kernel
module, but running as root (or going through the bother of adding the
capabilities to the binaries) is another option.

If you need PCI configuration register (CSR) support in Libmsr, you MUST have
CSR-SAFE installed. This code is not currently on Github -- you will need to
request it.

Call `msr_init()` before using any of the APIs.

For sample code, see `libmsr_test.c` in the `test/` directory.

Our most up-to-date documentation for Libmsr can be generated with `make doc`
and `make latex_doc` for HTML and PDF versions, respectively. There are also
some useful PDF files in the `documentation/` directory.

If you wish to use Libmsr on LLNL's Cab system, you will need to apply a patch
to gain MSR access. At this time, the patch will need to be requested as it is
not on Github.
